# The Knight Foundation (Summer 2019)
"what is our impact on the state of local news?"

This summer, I worked with the Journalism team at the Knight Foundation in Miami to study what success looks like and how to reproduce it in local news. 

As one part of a larger investigation, I gathered and geocoded data from the team as well as a couple grantees to begin to understand what our impact looks like across the country. 
Layering this data on top of the University of North Carolina's Map of News Deserts gave us a sense of to what extent we are combatting the current crisis in local news-- the disappearance of reliable and resilient local newsrooms and information sources.
